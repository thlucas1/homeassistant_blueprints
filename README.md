# Home Assistant Blueprint Library

Welcome to my Home Assistant Blueprint Library.

Blueprints are organized by functionality in separate folders.  Each Blueprint has a code file (.yaml extension) and a documentation file (.md extension) that contains set-up and usage of the blueprint.

Here are a few helpful links to get you started:
* [SoundTouchPlus Integration](./soundtouchplus/index.md)  
* [SpotifyPlus Integration](./spotifyplus)  


## Report a Problem
Are you having a problem with one of the BluePrints?  Submit a [Bug Report](https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistant_blueprints/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml) to bring the issue to my attention.  I receive a notification when a new issue is opened, and will do my best to address it in a prompt and professional manner.


## Request a New Feature
Do you have an idea for a new blueprint, or a feature that could be added to an existing blueprint?  Submit a [Feature Request](https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistant_blueprints/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature%2BRequest&projects=&template=feature_request.yml) to get your idea into the queue. I receive a notification when a new request is opened, and will do my best to turn your idea into the latest and greatest feature.
